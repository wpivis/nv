This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. \n\nThird, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn't match the certificate's information, or was not possible to verify.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize. \n\nIf the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish a man in the middle attack against the remote host.</description><solution>Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.</solution><risk_factor>Medium / CVSS Base Score : 6.4\n(CVSS2#AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)\n</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.57.103"><ReportItem port="443" pluginID="57582" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>6.4</cvss_base_score><synopsis>The SSL certificate chain for this service ends in an unrecognized self-signed certificate.</synopsis><description>The X.509 certificate chain for this service is not signed by a recognized certificate authority.

Sending a request with HTTP headers long enough to exceed the server limit causes the web server to respond with an HTTP 400.  By default, the offending HTTP header and value are displayed on the 400 error page.  When used in conjunction with other attacks (e.g., cross-site scripting), this could result in the compromise of httpOnly cookies.\n\nSee also :\n\nhttp://fd.the-wildcat.de/apache_e36a9cf46c.php\nhttp://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_22.html\nhttp://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view&amp;#61;revision&amp;revision&amp;#61;1235454</description><solution>Upgrade to Apache version 2.2.22 or later.</solution><risk_factor>Medium / CVSS Base Score : 4.3\n(CVSS2#AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)\n</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.58.103"><ReportItem port="notes" pluginID="54615" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>1</cvss_base_score><synopsis>It is possible to guess the remote device type.</synopsis><description>Based on the remote operating system, it is possible to determine what the remote system type is (eg: a printer, router, general-purpose computer, etc).</description><solution>n/a</solution><risk_factor>None</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.58.103"><ReportItem port="notes" pluginID="45590" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>1</cvss_base_score><synopsis>It is possible to enumerate CPE names that matched on the remote system.</synopsis><description>By using information obtained from a Nessus scan, this plugin reports CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) matches for various hardware and software products found on a host.  \n\nNote that if an official CPE is not available for the product, this plugin computes the best possible CPE based on the information available from the scan.\n\nSee also :\n\nhttp://cpe.mitre.org/</description><solution>n/a</solution><risk_factor>None</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.58.103"><ReportItem port="notes" pluginID="11936" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>1</cvss_base_score><synopsis>It is possible to guess the remote operating system.</synopsis><description>Using a combination of remote probes, (TCP/IP, SMB, HTTP, NTP, SNMP, etc...) it is possible to guess the name of the remote operating system in use, and sometimes its version.</description><solution>n/a</solution><risk_factor>None</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.58.103"><ReportItem port="12321" pluginID="20007" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>5</cvss_base_score><synopsis>The remote service encrypts traffic using a protocol with known weaknesses.</synopsis><description>The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0, which reportedly suffers from several cryptographic flaws and has been deprecated for several years.

This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted. \n\nFirst, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority. \n\nSecond, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. \n\nThird, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn't match the certificate's information, or was not possible to verify.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.
