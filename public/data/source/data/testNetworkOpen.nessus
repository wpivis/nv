Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize. \n\nIf the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish a man in the middle attack against the remote host.</description><solution>Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.</solution><risk_factor>Medium / CVSS Base Score : 6.4\n(CVSS2#AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)\n</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.57.102"><ReportItem port="443" pluginID="10863" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>1</cvss_base_score><synopsis>This plugin displays the SSL certificate.</synopsis><description>This plugin connects to every SSL-related port and attempts to extract and dump the X.509 certificate.</description><solution>n/a</solution><risk_factor>None</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.57.102"><ReportItem port="12321" pluginID="10863" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>1</cvss_base_score><synopsis>This plugin displays the SSL certificate.</synopsis><description>This plugin connects to every SSL-related port and attempts to extract and dump the X.509 certificate.</description><solution>n/a</solution><risk_factor>None</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.57.102"><ReportItem port="22" pluginID="10881" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>1</cvss_base_score><synopsis>A SSH server is running on the remote host.</synopsis><description>This plugin determines the versions of the SSH protocol supported by the remote SSH daemon.</description><solution>n/a</solution><risk_factor>None</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.57.102"><ReportItem port="443" pluginID="56984" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>1</cvss_base_score><synopsis>The remote service encrypts communications.</synopsis><description>This script detects which SSL and TLS versions are supported by the remote service for encrypting communications.</description><solution>n/a</solution><risk_factor>None</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.57.102"><ReportItem port="12321" pluginID="56984" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>1</cvss_base_score><synopsis>The remote service encrypts communications.</synopsis><description>This script detects which SSL and TLS versions are supported by the remote service for encrypting communications.</description><solution>n/a</solution><risk_factor>None</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.57.102"><ReportItem port="22" pluginID="11255" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>10</cvss_base_score><synopsis>An account on the remote host uses a known password.</synopsis><description>The account 'root' on the remote host has the password 'root.

Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize. \n\nIf the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish a man in the middle attack against the remote host.</description><solution>Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.</solution><risk_factor>Medium / CVSS Base Score : 6.4\n(CVSS2#AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)\n</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.57.105"><ReportItem port="443" pluginID="10863" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>1</cvss_base_score><synopsis>This plugin displays the SSL certificate.</synopsis><description>This plugin connects to every SSL-related port and attempts to extract and dump the X.509 certificate.</description><solution>n/a</solution><risk_factor>None</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.57.105"><ReportItem port="12321" pluginID="10863" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>1</cvss_base_score><synopsis>This plugin displays the SSL certificate.</synopsis><description>This plugin connects to every SSL-related port and attempts to extract and dump the X.509 certificate.</description><solution>n/a</solution><risk_factor>None</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.57.105"><ReportItem port="22" pluginID="10881" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>1</cvss_base_score><synopsis>A SSH server is running on the remote host.</synopsis><description>This plugin determines the versions of the SSH protocol supported by the remote SSH daemon.</description><solution>n/a</solution><risk_factor>None</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.57.105"><ReportItem port="443" pluginID="56984" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>1</cvss_base_score><synopsis>The remote service encrypts communications.</synopsis><description>This script detects which SSL and TLS versions are supported by the remote service for encrypting communications.</description><solution>n/a</solution><risk_factor>None</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.57.105"><ReportItem port="12321" pluginID="56984" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>1</cvss_base_score><synopsis>The remote service encrypts communications.</synopsis><description>This script detects which SSL and TLS versions are supported by the remote service for encrypting communications.</description><solution>n/a</solution><risk_factor>None</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.57.105"><ReportItem port="22" pluginID="11255" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>10</cvss_base_score><synopsis>An account on the remote host uses a known password.</synopsis><description>The account 'root' on the remote host has the password 'root.

This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted. \n\nFirst, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority. \n\nSecond, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. \n\nThird, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn't match the certificate's information, or was not possible to verify.

This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted. \n\nFirst, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority. \n\nSecond, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. \n\nThird, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn't match the certificate's information, or was not possible to verify.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize. \n\nIf the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish a man in the middle attack against the remote host.</description><solution>Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.</solution><risk_factor>Medium / CVSS Base Score : 6.4\n(CVSS2#AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)\n</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.58.102"><ReportItem port="443" pluginID="10863" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>1</cvss_base_score><synopsis>This plugin displays the SSL certificate.</synopsis><description>This plugin connects to every SSL-related port and attempts to extract and dump the X.509 certificate.</description><solution>n/a</solution><risk_factor>None</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.58.102"><ReportItem port="12321" pluginID="10863" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>1</cvss_base_score><synopsis>This plugin displays the SSL certificate.</synopsis><description>This plugin connects to every SSL-related port and attempts to extract and dump the X.509 certificate.</description><solution>n/a</solution><risk_factor>None</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.58.102"><ReportItem port="443" pluginID="56984" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>1</cvss_base_score><synopsis>The remote service encrypts communications.</synopsis><description>This script detects which SSL and TLS versions are supported by the remote service for encrypting communications.</description><solution>n/a</solution><risk_factor>None</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.58.102"><ReportItem port="12321" pluginID="56984" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>1</cvss_base_score><synopsis>The remote service encrypts communications.</synopsis><description>This script detects which SSL and TLS versions are supported by the remote service for encrypting communications.</description><solution>n/a</solution><risk_factor>None</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.58.102"><ReportItem port="22" pluginID="10881" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>1</cvss_base_score><synopsis>A SSH server is running on the remote host.</synopsis><description>This plugin determines the versions of the SSH protocol supported by the remote SSH daemon.</description><solution>n/a</solution><risk_factor>None</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.58.102"><ReportItem port="22" pluginID="11255" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>10</cvss_base_score><synopsis>An account on the remote host uses a known password.</synopsis><description>The account 'root' on the remote host has the password 'root.

This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted. \n\nFirst, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority. \n\nSecond, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. \n\nThird, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn't match the certificate's information, or was not possible to verify.

This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted. \n\nFirst, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority. \n\nSecond, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. \n\nThird, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn't match the certificate's information, or was not possible to verify.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize. \n\nIf the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish a man in the middle attack against the remote host.</description><solution>Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.</solution><risk_factor>Medium / CVSS Base Score : 6.4\n(CVSS2#AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)\n</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.58.105"><ReportItem port="443" pluginID="10863" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>1</cvss_base_score><synopsis>This plugin displays the SSL certificate.</synopsis><description>This plugin connects to every SSL-related port and attempts to extract and dump the X.509 certificate.</description><solution>n/a</solution><risk_factor>None</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.58.105"><ReportItem port="12321" pluginID="10863" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>1</cvss_base_score><synopsis>This plugin displays the SSL certificate.</synopsis><description>This plugin connects to every SSL-related port and attempts to extract and dump the X.509 certificate.</description><solution>n/a</solution><risk_factor>None</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.58.105"><ReportItem port="443" pluginID="56984" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>1</cvss_base_score><synopsis>The remote service encrypts communications.</synopsis><description>This script detects which SSL and TLS versions are supported by the remote service for encrypting communications.</description><solution>n/a</solution><risk_factor>None</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.58.105"><ReportItem port="12321" pluginID="56984" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>1</cvss_base_score><synopsis>The remote service encrypts communications.</synopsis><description>This script detects which SSL and TLS versions are supported by the remote service for encrypting communications.</description><solution>n/a</solution><risk_factor>None</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.58.105"><ReportItem port="22" pluginID="10881" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>1</cvss_base_score><synopsis>A SSH server is running on the remote host.</synopsis><description>This plugin determines the versions of the SSH protocol supported by the remote SSH daemon.</description><solution>n/a</solution><risk_factor>None</risk_factor><title>title</title></ReportItem></ReportHost><ReportHost name="192.168.58.105"><ReportItem port="22" pluginID="11255" severity="1"><cvss_base_score>10</cvss_base_score><synopsis>An account on the remote host uses a known password.</synopsis><description>The account 'root' on the remote host has the password 'root.
